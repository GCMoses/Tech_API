Hey there,

I just wanted to share with you the DataAPI that I've been working on. It's all about tech products, and I really put a lot of effort into making it top-notch. I used the Onion architecture to make sure it's well-structured and scalable, and I included some other features to make it super secure. For example, I used GUID values for link IDs to make sure no one can duplicate them and access sensitive data.

I also made sure to include async programming throughout the service layer and controllers so the API can handle multiple requests at once without any issues. Plus, I implemented JWT authentication to control who can access the API and what data they can see.

I'm happy to say that the API supports both XML and JSON link formatters, so clients can choose the one that works best for them. I also added some other useful features like throttling and search/filtering to make it even more valuable to clients.

Oh, and I made sure to document everything using Swagger, and I included error models to handle any unexpected server responses. All in all, I'm really proud of the DataAPI and I think it's a strong asset
