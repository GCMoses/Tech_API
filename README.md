# Tech_API
Made an API  with the business logic of a PC Store that has  PC Accessories, Parts PC builds and fully build Gaming PC's, Laptops &  Gaming Consoles...

First enabled logging into the API to help with troublehooting.
All the logic has been added. 
Logic was seeded into the database.
Created A Repository interface and classes for the services of the logic(similar to a UnitOfWork).

Using onion architecture to keep my code layered well.
